Creating a complete script for the app is a significant task and would require a comprehensive amount of code. Here, I'll provide a simplified version of the main components: the front-end (using React Native), the back-end (using Node.js and Express), and the AI integration (using TensorFlow.js). This will give you a foundational structure to build upon.

PART-1
Front-End (React Native)

First, set up a new React Native project:

        npx react-native init EnviroApp
        cd EnviroApp

Install necessary packages:

        npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack react-native-camera axios

PART-2
Back-End (Node.js and Express)
Set up a new Node.js project:


        mkdir backend
        cd backend
        npm init -y
        npm install express body-parser cors multer


PART-3
AI Integration (TensorFlow.js)
Install TensorFlow.js and MobileNet:


        npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-node @tensorflow-models/mobilenet image-js

In identifySpecies.js, load the MobileNet model and use it to classify the image provided by the user. The Image.load and tf.browser.fromPixels methods convert the image into a tensor that can be processed by the model.

Testing and Deployment
Run the Back-End Server:


        node index.js

Run the React Native App:


        npx react-native run-android
# or
        npx react-native run-ios


Testing:

Ensure the app can take pictures and send them to the server.
Verify that the server can process the image and return the correct species identification.


Deployment:

Host the back-end on a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
